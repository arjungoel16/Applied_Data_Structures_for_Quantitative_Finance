"""
risk_registry.py

Simulates a risk monitoring registry system within a financial institution. Each financial instrument is mapped to its
associated risk rating using dictionaries. Sets are used to efficiently track and detect instruments flagged
for compliance review.

Real-Life Use Case:
Used in compliance departments and risk management dashboards to quickly identify which active instruments are
under investigation or need review due to elevated risk levels.

Core Concepts:
- Dictionaries for storing instrument metadata
- Sets for efficient membership and intersection operations

Risk Assessment and Registry using Dictionaries and Sets

Uses sets for quick lookup and dictionaries for structured metadata.
